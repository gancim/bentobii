**Example Prompt:**
```
Generate a diabetic-friendly, weight-loss recipe for Spain. Include all fields: emoji icon, name (ja/es), description (ja/es), type, prepTime, cookTime, servings, difficulty, calories, carbs, protein, fat, fiber, sodium, ingredients (ja/es), instructions (ja/es), tags, country: 'ES'.
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Recipe Object Structure

Each recipe should be a JavaScript object with the following structure:

```js
{
  id: <number>,
  name: { ja: "...", <local>: "..." },
  icon: "üç≥",
  description: { ja: "...", <local>: "..." },
  type: "breakfast" | "lunch" | "dinner" | "snack",
  prepTime: <number>,
  cookTime: <number>,
  servings: <number>,
  difficulty: "easy" | "medium" | "hard",
  calories: <number>,
  carbs: <number>,
  protein: <number>,
  fat: <number>,
  fiber: <number>,
  sodium: <number>,
  ingredients: {
    ja: ["..."],
    <local>: ["..."]
  },
  instructions: {
    ja: ["..."],
    <local>: ["..."]
  },
  tags: ["diabetic-friendly", ...],
  country: '<COUNTRY_CODE>'
}
```

- `<local>` is the language code for the country (e.g. `it` for Italian, `es` for Spanish).
- `country` should be the ISO 2-letter country code.

## üåç Adding Recipes for New Countries
- Create a new file: `recipes.<country_code>.js` (e.g. `recipes.es.js` for Spain).
- Export an array of recipes as `<country>Recipes` (e.g. `export const spanishRecipes = [...]`).
- Import and merge these in `app.js` as needed.

## üè∑Ô∏è Translation Guidelines
- Always provide both Japanese and the local language for `name`, `description`, `ingredients`, and `instructions`.
- Use clear, simple language for both translations.
